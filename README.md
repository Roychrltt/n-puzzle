# N-Puzzle Solver

A modern C++ implementation of the N-Puzzle solver using A* search with multiple heuristics with a clean, modular design.

## Features
- Solves n-puzzle of any dimension (3*3, 4*4, or bigger)

- Implements A* search algorithm and its variants (uniform cost and greedy search)

- Supports different heuristics:
  - Manhattan distance
  - Misplaced tiles
  - Linear conflict (if implemented)
  - 

Displays solution steps clearly

Optional interactive mode to input your puzzle configuration

Handles unsolvable puzzles gracefully
